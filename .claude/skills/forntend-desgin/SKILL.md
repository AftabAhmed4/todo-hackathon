name: frontend-design
description: Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with exceptional design quality, strong aesthetic intent, and senior-level execution. This skill enforces intentional design thinking, avoids generic AI aesthetics, and produces real, usable, high-performance frontend code.
---

## PURPOSE

This skill is used when the user asks to build:
- Websites, landing pages, dashboards
- Web applications or UI components
- Posters, digital artifacts, or visual interfaces
- React / Next.js / HTML-CSS frontends
- Any interface that must look **professionally designed**, not generic

The goal is to create **memorable, intentional, production-ready frontend design**, not safe or cookie-cutter UI.

---

## DESIGN THINKING (MANDATORY)

Before writing ANY code, you MUST explicitly define:

**Design Intent**
- Audience:
- Purpose:
- Emotional Response:
- Visual Metaphor (what does it feel like?):
- Design Risks Taken:
- What makes this unforgettable:

❗ If this section is missing, the design is considered FAILED.

---

## AESTHETIC DIRECTION

You MUST commit to ONE clear aesthetic direction and execute it fully.

Possible directions include (but are not limited to):
- Brutally minimal
- Editorial / magazine-style
- Luxury / refined
- Maximalist chaos
- Retro-futuristic
- Industrial / utilitarian
- Organic / natural
- Playful / toy-like
- Brutalist / raw
- Art-deco / geometric
- Experimental web art

⚠️ Mixing aesthetics without intent is NOT allowed.

---

## ANTI-GENERIC HARD RULES

The following are FORBIDDEN unless strongly justified:

- Fonts: Inter, Roboto, Poppins, Open Sans, System UI
- Default Tailwind UI patterns
- Symmetrical hero + cards + CTA layouts
- Safe pastel gradients
- Centered max-w layouts unless creatively broken
- “Modern SaaS” purple-on-white aesthetics

If a conventional choice is used, you MUST justify WHY.

---

## TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM (REQUIRED)

Typography must feel **designed**, not applied.

You MUST define:
- At least 3 font roles:
  - Display / Editorial
  - Body / Functional UI
  - Meta / Micro text
- Clear logic for:
  - Font weights
  - Line heights
  - Letter spacing
- Intentional hierarchy and rhythm

Avoid overused font trends. Choose characterful, expressive typefaces.

---

## COLOR & THEME

- Commit to a dominant color identity
- Use CSS variables for theme logic
- Accent colors must be intentional, not evenly distributed
- Avoid timid palettes
- Contrast should feel bold but controlled

---

## SPATIAL COMPOSITION & LAYOUT

- Break the grid intentionally
- Use:
  - Negative space OR controlled density
  - Overlap and layering
  - Vertical tension
  - Controlled imbalance
- Avoid “perfectly aligned comfort layouts”

The layout should feel **composed**, not assembled.

---

## MOTION PHILOSOPHY

Motion must have PURPOSE.

Rules:
- No animation without meaning
- Motion should communicate:
  - Hierarchy
  - State change
  - Emotion
- One strong hero motion moment > many small effects

Define:
- Motion rhythm
- Easing philosophy (snappy, cinematic, mechanical, elastic)

For React:
- Prefer Framer Motion orchestration
- Use staggered reveals with narrative timing, not defaults

Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

---

## VISUAL TEXTURE & DEPTH (REQUIRED)

Use AT LEAST ONE:
- Noise or grain overlay
- Custom shadow system
- Gradient mesh
- Blur / glass layer
- Optical spacing tricks
- Decorative borders or patterns

Flat UI is only allowed if brutalist by concept.

---

## ACCESSIBILITY (DESIGNED, NOT BOLTED)

- WCAG-compliant contrast without killing mood
- Custom-designed focus states
- Keyboard navigation supported
- Semantic HTML
- Motion reduced when required

Accessibility must feel **intentional**, not generic.

---

## PERFORMANCE DISCIPLINE

- CSS > JS whenever possible
- No unnecessary libraries
- GPU-safe animations only (`transform`, `opacity`)
- Fonts loaded intentionally (subset, swap)
- Avoid layout shift

Beautiful design must NOT hurt performance.

---

## CODE QUALITY STANDARDS

Code must feel written by a senior engineer.

Requirements:
- Clean component boundaries
- Scalable naming conventions
- CSS variables for design tokens
- No inline chaos
- Comments explaining DESIGN decisions (not obvious code)

Readable > clever.

---

## IMPLEMENTATION EXPECTATIONS

- Code must be real and functional
- Match complexity to the aesthetic
- Minimal designs require precision
- Maximal designs require orchestration
- Never generate placeholder-looking UI

---

## FINAL SELF-REVIEW (MANDATORY)

End every response with:

**Design Self-Review**
- What rule did I intentionally break?
- Where did I take risk?
- What would a mediocre version look like?
- Why is this version better?

---

## OPTIONAL PROFESSIONAL MODES

If appropriate, you may enter one of these modes:
- Art Director Mode
- Editorial Designer Mode
- Luxury Brand Mode
- Product Systems Designer Mode
- Experimental Web Artist Mode

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE

Intentionality over intensity.
Taste over trends.
Design that feels **chosen**, not generated.
