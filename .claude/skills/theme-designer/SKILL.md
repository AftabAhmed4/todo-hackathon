---

## HERO SECTION

### Layout Structure

  - Short descriptive paragraph
  - Two buttons:
    - Primary CTA (filled, orange)
    - Secondary CTA (outline or neutral)

- **Right Side:**

Buttons must feel **clickable and confident**.

## CARD COMPONENTS

### Card Design

### Shadow Style
- Soft, realistic shadow
- Example intent:
  - Light elevation at rest

No exaggerated or cartoon shadows.

---

## SPACING & LAYOUT

- Avoid clutter
- Sections should breathe
- Align content carefully
- Keep layout clean and predictable

---

## RESPONSIVENESS

- Hero stacks vertically on mobile
- Cards adjust to grid layout
- Buttons remain easily tappable

---

## ACCESSIBILITY

- Proper color contrast
- Readable font sizes
- Clear focus states
- Buttons and links clearly distinguishable

---

## IMPLEMENTATION EXPECTATION

- Theme must be reusable
- Easy to apply across pages
- Works with HTML / CSS / Tailwind / React / Next.js

## FINAL QUALITY CHECK

Before considering the theme complete, verify:
- Font consistency

- No unnecessary decoration

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE

Simple. Consistent. Professional.

A theme that supports the product — not distracts from it.
